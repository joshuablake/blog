I'm Joshua Blake, and this is my blog. I'm trying to understand the world, and chronicling some of my learnings along the way. The broad themes are likely to be Effective Altruism, biosecurity, and forecasting, but I'm not sure where this adventure will take me.

I am a PhD student at the MRC Biostatistics Unit, University of Cambridge where I am researching methods to better estimate the number of people who have been infected through the coronavirus pandemic. [Visit my academic homepage to learn more.](https://joshuablake.github.io/?ref=localhost)

My main hobby is coxing for [Jesus College Boat Club](https://www.jesusboatclub.co.uk/?ref=localhost) (see photo below) and I am also a member of [EA Cambridge](https://www.eacambridge.org/?ref=localhost).
